## About
This is a **path** for those who is interested in learning **Machine Learning/Deep Learning/AI** course on your own time, **for free**. The list comprises of videos, articles, courses, lectures etc. 

## How to use this guide
The intention of this path is not to conclude everything on this list. The list is to guide me on the things I can focus on in the coming weeks. I am expected to spend at least 2 hours very day (to cover 10 - 30 hours per week). That is what is important for me, progress daily.

## Motivation
Here is an interesting link the Twitter page of an AI community in Nigeria, doing great things. I am inspired by their works.
